Game submission for the LiquidHacks 2020 Hackathon!

DESCRIPTION:
"Blue Loves You" is our text-based game submission for LiquidHacks 2020. The game is a simple combination of visual novel basics with an approach towards health and wellness, as the player and Blue chat and do some self-care exercises together.

HOW TO PLAY: 
Simply left-click the indicated buttons on the screen to follow through the text-based game experience (the "next" button will take you through various phrases of Blue's speech). 

DEV NOTES:
Thank you so much for checking out our hackathon submission! Although our group did not qualify for the beginner category, we were all very inexperienced with non-game software development practices. Though "Blue Loves You" was not our original plan for the hackathon, we were happy to be able to put something together for this very incredible opportunity, and we hope you enjoy our game!
